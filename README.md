Jet: a remote text editor
==================
Now that I think about it... Arte would be a good name for this.

# disclaimer
This project is not even in alpha so everything is subject to change at any moment.

# dependencies
- ncurses

# build
- make

# usage

- on a terminal execute:

path_to_project/jet #server

- on other terminal execute:

path_to_project/jet2 #client

# key bindings
Current key bindings work kinda like vim.

- h: move left
- l: move right
- i: enter insert mode
- C-g: on insert mode it exits to normal mode, on normal mode it exits the client

For now only a linux build is available.
